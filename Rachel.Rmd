* My name means "fox" in Gaelic. I was named after a talking fox in my human's favorite childhood book, [The Hounds of the Morrigan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13843.The_Hounds_of_the_M_rr_gan). 

* I am learning agility! But sometimes I still [make mistakes.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/pBp9V2cC59izU4eD8)

*My favorite thing to do is to go trail running with my human, because sometimes I get to CHASE SQUIRRELS!
